I encountered several real-world issues such as incorrect image path handling on Windows, OpenCV data type mismatches during arithmetic operations, and merge conflicts arising from unrelated Git histories and local changes. These challenges required debugging at both the code and tooling level, including understanding OpenCV’s strict type requirements, resolving merge conflicts safely using stashing, and correctly structuring folders and files on GitHub
